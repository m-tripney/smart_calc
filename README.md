## Overview
A 'smart' calculator app, with variables and postifx notation.
### Variables
- Variables names cannot include numbers.
- Names can be any length.
- Names are case-sensitive.
- Variables are declared like so:
    - `a = 10`
    - `m=4`
    - `twenty =20`
### Parentheses checker
The calculator recognises when parentheses are mismatched.
### Postfix notation
Behind the scenes, the calculator converts the user's infix notation to postfix, before resolving an answer.
